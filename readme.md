## Project Sandwich

### What is it about

Well the title might said something about it.
The exact project description will be provided later on. For now it's not much more then a simple database setup without anything done yet in the controllers and such...

This project will be build on [Laravel 4.1](http://laravel.com)

### Todo after clone

Get the framework...
	
	composer install

Touch the databases
	
	mkdir app/database/files
	touch app/database/files/production.sqlite
	touch app/database/files/development.sqlite
	touch app/database/files/sessions.sqlite

Migrate some stuff and seed it

	./artisan migrate --seed

Have fun.
The project is far, realy like, this is version 0.0.0.0.1.a, that far from being done :D
